                    <p>Shift-Two is a mod that I made on my free time when I was in secondary school. The experience I gained from the 2 years I spent working on it would later prove extremely useful in managing personal as well as team projects.</p>
                    <p>I learnt HTML, CSS and the basics of 3D modelling. The technology used being old and closed-source, I also gained a lot of experience in learning through trial-and-errors.</p>

                    <p>Wordpress, Javascript, Bootstrap and Git were technologies I had to quickly become familiar with to deliver the theme on time.</p>

                    <p>I joined an online community project which consisted in putting together the levels made by each participant.</p>
                    <p>I chose to recreate a real-world location. This proved extremely difficult as the amount of details was enourmous. Besides, staying consistent with the real-world dimensions was equally challenging without specialised material.</p>
                    <p>I spent a big part of my summer working on this project and recreating with the correct dimensions each object from the real world (windows, tables…).</p>

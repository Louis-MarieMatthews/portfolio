            <h1>Level Design & Blender</h1>
            <p>My first experience with 3D modelisation goes back in 2010. This is when I discovered how 3D objects and environments in video games where made thanks to a tutorial 
            of OpenClassrooms.</p>
            <p>I became passionate about creating my own 3D worlds and this culminated in the release of my very own video game, Shift-Two, in April 2011.
            Shift-Two is a mod, which means it is a video game reusing a variable amount of assets from a another video game, in this case Half-Life 1. The mod brings new levels,
            a different storyset and new textures to the original game. I was willing to create a website for my mod, and this was the perfect occasion to get a first glimpse into
            web development. I learnt HTML and CSS and used these technologies to create my very first website.</p>
            <p>I continued to practice mapping over the following years (and tried to gather and strengthen the level designers community). I jumped into the next step which was
            learn Blender in 2014 in order to bring more details to my levels.
            This powerful software, very different from Valve Hammer Editor (the software used to create levels for Half-Life 1 games), was challenging to learn.
            Also challenging was the integration of my Blender models in levels designed for a game engine about 20 years old. This required using softwares and plugins to convert
            my files from the .blend format to the .mdl format, used by my mod.</p>
            <p>The idea of using my skills to recreate my house was floating in my mind for quite a long time. The proposal of a new online community mod was for me a chance to 
            bring that idea to reality. This involved a lot of work over the summer. I had to take the dimensions of an important amount of objects in my house in order to recreate
            them in my map. In addition to being decoration, they also provided me with a visual clue of the dimension of the structure of my level, and I was able to use them
            as some sort of landmarks in order to get the dimensions of my walls, floors and ceilings correct.</p>

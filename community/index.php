            <p>As I was learning, and later practising level design, I noticed level designers and resources for Half-Life 1, such as tutorials, were scattered 
            accross a variety of small websites, threateting the community and the creations of everywhone. Beside, it was sometimes hard for beginners to know
            where to start and what community to join.</p>
            <p>This is why, with a few other members of the website OpenClassrooms, we decided to create a website aimed at gathering all the level designers for 
            any Goldsource games (including Half-Life 1), and creating and sharing resources such as video tutorials.</p>
            <p>The website is unavailable at the moment, but a new version of it is in preparation. In the meantime, we've still got our Youtube channel onto which 
            I upload video tutorials I make, our Steam group composed of level designers I found and contacted accross the Internet, and our Facebook, Twitter and
            Google+ pages, where I regularly share new contents related to the Goldsource world.</p>

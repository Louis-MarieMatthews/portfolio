            <h1>Programming</h1>
            <p>The first programming language I learnt was PHP, reading a tutorial of OpenClassrooms.
            Its simple syntax made it a perfect introduction to programming languages for me.
            Although I did not learn it for any specific purposes, it would later prove extremely useful as it allowed me to be prepared for some university assignments, 
            become the webmaster of Dundee University Review of the Arts and also understand the logic of a programming languages, making learning other languages much
            more easier.</p>
            <p>I learnt Java, ASP.NET, Arduino and Processing as part of my university course. In second year, we were tasked to make a video game using the technology
            of our choice. I decided to learn C++ and use Allegro to draw 2D graphics as it was the perfect opportunity for me to learn and gain experience in this 
            ubiquitous language, which would afterwards allow me to learn OpenGL and contribute to community projects related to Half-Life 1 modding.</p>
